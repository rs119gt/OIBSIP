                    <h2>About Leonardo da Vinci</h2>
                    <p>Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci (15 April 1452 â€“ 2 May 1519) was an Italian polymath whose areas of interest included invention, 
                        painting, sculpting, architecture, science, music, mathematics, engineering, literature, anatomy, geology, astronomy, botany, 
                        writing, history, and cartography. He has been variously called the father of palaeontology, ichnology, and architecture, and 
                        is widely considered one of the greatest painters of all time. Sometimes credited with the inventions of the parachute, 
                        helicopter and tank, he epitomised the Renaissance humanist ideal.</p>

                <h2>Early Life and Education</h2>
                <p>Leonardo da Vinci was born on April 15, 1452, in Vinci, Italy. He was the illegitimate son of Ser Piero da Vinci, a notary, and 
                    Caterina, a peasant woman. Despite his humble beginnings, Leonardo showed remarkable talent from a young age. 
                    He received early education in subjects like reading, writing, and arithmetic.At the age of 14, he began an apprenticeship with 
                    Andrea del Verrocchio, a renowned artist and sculptor of the time. This marked the beginning of Leonardo's journey into the world 
                    of art and innovation.</p>

                <h2>Scientific Contributions</h2>
                <p>In addition to his artistic achievements, Leonardo made groundbreaking contributions to various scientific disciplines. He conducted meticulous studies of anatomy, producing detailed drawings of the human body that are still used in medical education today.</p>
                <p>His fascination with nature led him to study and document various phenomena, such as the flight of birds, the flow of water, and the growth patterns of plants. His notebooks contain sketches and observations that reflect his keen scientific mind.</p>

                <h2>Engineering and Inventions</h2>
                <p>Leonardo's creativity extended beyond art and science; he was also an ingenious engineer and inventor. He conceptualized and sketched inventions that were ahead of his time, including designs for flying machines, war machines, and architectural innovations.</p>
                <p>One of his famous designs is the <em>ornithopter</em>, a machine that mimicked bird flight by flapping its wings. Although many of his inventions were never built during his lifetime, they showcase his innovative thinking and the breadth of his interests.</p>

            <div id="legacy" class="legacy">
                <h2>Legacy</h2>
                <p>Leonardo da Vinci's legacy is felt across multiple disciplines. His artistic techniques, such as sfumato (a soft blending of colors), have influenced generations of painters. His scientific approach to observation and documentation laid the foundation for modern scientific methodology.</p>
                <p>His works continue to inspire artists, scientists, and thinkers to this day. Leonardo's ability to bridge the gap between art and science exemplifies the spirit of the Renaissance, where intellectual curiosity and artistic expression converged.</p>
